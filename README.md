Personally, I ALWAYS use [VirusTotal.com](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/url) to scan links and files before clicking/downloading.


# ~ Neopets Item Price Tooltip ~

Shows a calculated market price for items on the Inventory, Quick Stock, and your Shop pages using ItemDB, with a Jellyneo link and price warning indicators.


# ~ How To Use ~

Navigate to the Iventory/Quick Stock/or Market page and highlight any item text to instantly search for prices. It will provide a tooltip with the info and a link to the item page on JellyNeo.

>It takes the 20 most recent prices from the ItemDB Trade History and returns the median value of those 20 prices!

>It will display an asterisk (*) if there are less than 20 prices in the Trade History.

>It will display a red exclamation mark (!) if there are any links or the words added/unavailable in the first price column instead of a value.

# ~ Extra Info ~

This won't replace looking up the prices of items before you stock them if you like to stay competitive in pricing. It will just help speed up finding the junk and low-value items to dump quickly without having to look up each item.

This is a Tampermonkey Plugin script I designed for Chrome; may work on FireFox.

Install 'TamperMonkey' Extension on Chrome from either the App Store or the Extension's Website; I used App Store.

>Quick How-To: Download Tampermonkey, add/create new script, copy/paste my code. Click Save, Navigate to one of the pages, reload it, highlight item text.
