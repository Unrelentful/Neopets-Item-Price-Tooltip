Description: Shows the market price for items via tooltip on the Quick Stock page using ItemDB when highlighting text.

>It takes the 10 most recent prices from the Trade History and returns the median value of those 10 prices!

>It also will display an asterisk (*) if there are less than 10 prices in the Trade History.

This is a Tampermonkey Plugin script. Only for Chrome.
Install 'TamperMonkey' Extension on Chrome from either the App Store or the Extension's Website; I used App Store.

>Quick How-To: Download Tampermonkey, add/create new script, copy/paste my code. Click Save, Navigate to the Quick Stock Page, reload it, highlight item text.
