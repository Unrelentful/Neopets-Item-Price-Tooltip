Description: Shows the market price for items on the Inventory, Quick Stock, and your Shop pages using ItemDB when highlighting text.

>It takes the 10 most recent prices from the Trade History and returns the mean value of those 10 prices!

>It also will display an asterisk (*) if there are less than 10 prices in the Trade History.

This is a Tampermonkey Plugin script I designed for Chrome; may work on FireFox.

Install 'TamperMonkey' Extension on Chrome from either the App Store or the Extension's Website; I used App Store.

>Quick How-To: Download Tampermonkey, add/create new script, copy/paste my code. Click Save, Navigate to one of the pages, reload it, highlight item text.
